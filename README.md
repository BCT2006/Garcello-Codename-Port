Before you say anything, this isnt a 1 to 1 port, theres still a few things missing i know.

hi i ported garcello mod to codenamelol

I usually use SEOS to practice and get used to making things in different engines, I did it with psych and yce, now im doing it with codename.
I usually don't release them, but I though I should release this one, maybe people could use it as a resource to find out how to do stuff with codename.

I made this in like 2 hours, and I plan to update it.

If you have questions on how something works you can ping me in the codename discord, no promises that ill respond though.
